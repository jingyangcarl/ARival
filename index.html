        A-Rival is an Augmented Reality (AR) based 3D online multiplayer card battle game. It allows users to view the
        card battlefield, the decks of each player and vivid 3D models of the summoned characters in an immersive
        environment with AR scenes. Game playgrounds and contents are rendered in 3D spaces to allow players view from
        360 degree angles. Users can also use gestures to draw cards, summon the creatures and use the magic to heal or
        destroy enemies.

    <h3> Inspiration </h3>
    <p> A-Rival is inspired by Blizzard’s well-known online card game HearthStone, as well as the famous trading card
        game Yu-Gi-Oh. The fundamental game play will be similar to HearthStone which is strategy turn-based and mana
        cost effective.</p>

    <p>Majority of the 3D mesh characters and animations will be acquired from Mixamo and Sketchfab and processed with
        blender. The play background scene will be rendered with ARkit. </p>

    <h3> Core Play </h3>

    <div style="width:45%; float:left;">
        <p>Each player will set a deck with 20 cards for a game. The card contains summon cards and magic cards. Each
            player
            will have 15 HP in a game. In one turn, the player can use the summon cards, cast spells using magic cards
            and
            manipulate the summons to attack opponents. The player first loses all HP will lose the game. For each turn,
            the
            player will have at most one and a half minutes to think of the strategy. If the time reaches the limit or
            the
            player clicks the button of finish, this turn will be over and the other player’s turn will begin.
        </p>
