A-Rival is an Augmented Reality (AR) based 3D online multiplayer card battle game. It allows users to view the card battlefield, the decks of each player and vivid 3D models of the summoned characters in an immersive environment with AR scenes. Game playgrounds and contents are rendered in 3D spaces to allow players view from 360 degree angles. Users can also use gestures to draw cards, summon the creatures and use the magic to heal or destroy enemies.
